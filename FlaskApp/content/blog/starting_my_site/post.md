# Creating a Website

I've resisted creating a website for a really long time because I dislike HTML, and always felt that using a CMS like Drupal was massively overkill.

## Why bother?

I never really bothered with creating a web-page or getting into any web based technologies as I was more interested in making "real tools". This was idiotic thinking and I thought that this was as good a chance 

## Initial Ideas

* Not basic HTML.
* Use it as an opportunity to research web technologies

# Website

Creating a website.

## Brief



## Initial Ideas

* Find a good technology which isn't too heavyweight
* Experiment with cluster systems as well as the web technology
* Two part design, one for the framework and another for the content.

## Research

Initially I thought about using Python as the main framework technology. I'm familiar with Python so I though this was a good plan.

Flask is a lightweight framework which as a stupidly good support base. It seemed to tick a lot of the boxes. E.g. support for rendering markdown which can be used for creating and maintaining the content.

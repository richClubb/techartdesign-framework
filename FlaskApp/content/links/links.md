# Makers

These are makers or people who have given me some inspiration.

## [3x3 Custom](https://www.youtube.com/c/3x3CustomTamar)

A US based woodworker who has a great variety of sensible projects and designs. She has a great sense of design and isn't afraid to experiment and publish her mistakes.

She has a mostly power-tool based approach and doesn't tend to use a lot of hand-tools. She doesn't have a crazy tool collection and has a lot of methods and jigs to make up some of the shortfalls in her equipment.

### Topics

Woodworking, design


## [Stuff Made Here](https://www.youtube.com/c/StuffMadeHere)

Great sense of humor and a variety of cool projects. He makes some really strange projects, some of which are not really easily DIY, but the ideas are really cool.

Mental tool collection... Definitely uses them, but just wow.

### Topics

Maker, electronics, programming, mechanical

## [Chris Salomone](https://www.youtube.com/c/ChrisSalomone1)

They have a really impressive design eye and make some great looking furniture. They outline a lot of their design methodology which is really cool if you're trying to learn about design.

Primarily power-tool focused.

## [Ishitani Furniture](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC7FkqjV8SU5I8FCHXQSQe9Q)

A Japanese woodworker. I can't describe how amazing his designs are, and watching him make his furniture is medative. I can easily just sit and watch it for hours. I'd love to be able to actually go to Japan to see him work in person.

I definitely aspire to actually own one of his pieces.

Has a hybrid approach and uses a good mix of power and hand tools. His tool collection is very old school and very cool.

## [Squarerule Furniture](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCJkUhZ4Zlk6HTmeV-M4q06g)

A Korean woodworker with some amazing designs. Like Ishitani Furniture his videos are very meditative and I can easily watch them for hours. His design are amazing and some of the uses of live edges are inspiring.

Has a hybrid approach to woodworking.

## [Laura Kampf](https://www.youtube.com/c/laurakampf)

German based maker, focuses on wood and metalworking. Has a really good design focusing more on industrial / bare designs rather than uber clean commercial furniture.

Has a real flair for making good stuff out of old things. Her piece on the [bench she made](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RbQGLaLDEA4) on the Rhine River is a really cool way of thinking

## [Alexandre Chappel](https://www.youtube.com/c/achappel)

A huge inspiration for cool projects. A mixture of great designs and cool methods. I'd recommend looking as his [assortment boxes](https://www.alch.shop/shop/p/assortment-system-master-set) which are super useful and I have them set up in some of my organisation boxes at home.

### Topics

## [Stumpy Nubs](https://www.youtube.com/c/StumpyNubs)

US based woodworker. Has a hybrid woodworking method (power tools and hand tools). I'd recommend following him as he is just super sensible and has a lot of good common sense advice.

### Topics

Woodworking, just good old common sense.
